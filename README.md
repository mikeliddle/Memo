# [Memo](https://mikeliddle.github.io/Memo/)
An Alexa skill for leaving messages for other individuals in a household

Have you ever needed to remind your child to take out the trash when they get home?  Or to clean their room?  Or remind your roommate your concert is tonight?

Problem solved in a pain-free way with Alexa and **Memo**!

Just say, _"Alexa, tell Memo to remind Mary"_ and leave a reminder for her.  Or, _"Alexa, tell Memo to leave a message for John."_ 

There are three features in this skill: leave a message, listen to all messages, and delete all messages.
